				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<img src="./img/karen.jpeg">
				<p>Hey everyone! My name is Karen Wong. I am an 18 year old undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science who is looking forward to make a change in technology and design. I am mainly interested in cybersecurity, web development and artificial intelligence. I am also an enthusiastic learner who’s open to new opportunities to help the community and strive for a sustainable environment.</p>

					<h3>Undergraduate Student</h3>
					<p>I am an upcoming junior at Seattle University, starting from Fall 2019. I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science. I was a transfer student from North Seattle College and achieved an Associate's of Science degree along with a high school diploma. </p>

					<p>Within my major of Computer Science, I have always been interested in taking classes in Computer Security because it is pivotal in our lives, especially with the ethical issues that we face in this modern age, such as the threats of fraud, security, and identity theft. I am excited to start at Seattle University because this school also gives a great platform for students of diverse backgrounds like me to get internship opportunities from companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and many more startup companies. My goal in this school is to be a resourceful, knowledgeable and hardworking individual who has a passion to make a positive and impactful change in every aspect of life. </p>

					<h3>Programmer</h3>
					<p>My first time doing hands-on programming was when I took programming classes in North Seattle College, which used Python and Java. In this coming winter quarter, I was granted the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for a CSC110 class -- Introduction to Computer Programming class. </p>

					<p>I participated in CodeDay Seattle and gained more programming experience from it. Luckily, I was fortunate enough collaborate with my peers to work on developing a Chrome extension where we only had 24 hours to do so. When the cursor hovers over a price of the item on an e-commerce website such as Amazon, the suggestion extension will display a pop-up with funny and random objects (e.g. spoons, dolls or pool noodles) that could also be bought with the same amount of money. We used HTTP, JavaScript and CSS for this project. By the end of the event, we received the ‘Best in Class’ award. This success intensified my passion to be a woman in Computer Science.</p>

					<h3>Handlettering Artist</h3>
					<p>This skill started to blossom back in September 2016 when I was watching videos of professional calligraphers creating beautiful, sophisticated, and intricate works of art. Having the desire to recreate those beautiful pieces, I practiced for weeks, even months, probably wasting more ink and recycled paper than an average fifteen year old would.</p>

					<p>In the process of cultivating this skill, I discovered that doing modern calligraphy takes incredible patience and dedication because any artwork that is put out reflects the amount of emotion the artist puts in. Doing modern calligraphy stimulates my creativity in all aspects of my life including programming. Moreover, doing this has been extremely therapeutic for me. Even on my worst days, in times of sadness, grief, anxiety, and stress, I find myself coming back to my desk, rummaging for my brush pens and sketch books, to pour my feelings out. I consider my best pieces to be the ones that are done during these hard times because I can express my emotions and pain in making art.</p>
