					<p> Born and raised as a Chinese-Indonesian, I have always been entangled between both of these unique cultures. I was brought up mainly speaking Cantonese and English at a young age. In exchange, I am not as proficient in my native language, Bahasa Indonesia. Growing up as an only child in a traditional Asian household, I felt an underlying expectation to perform my best even though I was not pressured to do so. Additionally, I have always felt like academics was something that I was consistently good at, which gradually turned me into an overachiever.</p>

					<p>Like every other child, I had many ambitions from dreaming to become a doctor, fashion designer or teacher. At the age of 10, a keen interest in technology and problem-solving developed in me. During that time, my father had been working as a technical consultant manager for two years at Lenovo Indonesia and I had always seen how hard he worked for his clients. Additionally, he would always tell me about the new gadgets that the company was working on. From that time onwards, my father has always been a significant influence in my life and my curiosity for technology has continued to blossom.</p>

					<p>I was first introduced to the theory of computer science in high-school, where I learned about binary systems, computer ethics, operating systems, and writing pseudocodes in Visual Basic. Even though I learned a lot in high school, I had to face one major obstacle that almost made me doubt myself. I had to face the sexism that came from my computer science teacher and some of my classmates; they thought that it was very unusual for a girl to pursue a “male-dominated” field, which made me feel insecure and discouraged about my goals. Luckily, I was surrounded by my supportive family and inner circle of friends who refused to watch me give up on something that I had worked so hard for. I held onto the hope that I would get a better education and a more supportive culture when I was given a chance to study in the United States, and I was right. I have learned that I should not let others prevent me from achieving my goals.</p>

					<p>After graduating from the 10th grade in Indonesia, I decided to continue my education at North Seattle College (NSC). A sequence of programming classes at NSC gave me my first experience in hands-on programming, using Python and Java. Thankfully, with hard work and the help of supportive teachers, I was able to excel in those classes. Aside from my classes, I got to implement my knowledge in programming by joining the Computer Science Club at NSC where we went on a Microsoft Tour, designed games, set up a Raspberry Pi with Google Assistant and attended hackathons. Last winter, I participated in CodeDay Seattle with a few of the club members to challenge our abilities. We developed a Chrome extension called “Suggestion Extension” within 24 hours which suggests random objects (e.g. spoons or dolls) to the user that could also be bought with the same amount of money that the cursor is hovering over. We used HTTP, JavaScript, and CSS for this project. That day, we received the “Best in Class” award for making an exceptionally creative, challenging, and polished project. This experience reinforced my knowledge of real-life applications in programming.</p>

					<p>Currently, I have gained more hands-on experience as a Math and Computer Science tutor at NSC; I help students understand the fundamental concepts and develop problem-solving strategies for those courses. With students coming from different classes and levels, I am exposed to more questions of varying difficulties. Not only do I help students achieve their goals academically, but I also help them build their self-confidence through relentless encouragement while tutoring. This is important because sometimes they come to me with their doubts while belittling themselves for not understanding a concept as quickly as their peers. This has inspired me to encourage students to be comfortable and unafraid to voice their doubts when being tutored. In these experiences, I also interact and work with people of different backgrounds and cultures, which enhances my interpersonal skills and ability to be empathetic towards people. I was also granted the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for Instructor Vince Offenback for his Introduction to Computer Programming class at NSC during this 2019 winter quarter where I guide students who are new to Python and answer their technical questions. These skills are important to me because, in my field of study and line of work, it is crucial to understand what the clients want from a supplier's standpoint.
					Within my major of Computer Science, I have always been interested in taking classes in Computer Security because it is pivotal in our lives, especially with the ethical issues that we face in this modern age, such as the threats of fraud, security, and identity theft.</p>
